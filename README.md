> FrontBook is a small and modern frontend boilerplate, made for developers who miss a good starting point to write **ES201* today** in production-ready projects.

## ⚙ Setups
FrontBook comes with different setups, `npm scripts` being the default:

| Setup | Version | Branch |
| :---- | :-----: | :----: |
| [**npm scripts**](https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook) | `1.0.0` | `master` |
| [Grunt](https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/tree/grunt) | `1.3.2` | `grunt` |
| [gulp](https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/tree/gulp) | `1.3.2` | `gulp` |

Choose one and get started!

## 💾 Quick Start FrontBook
### 1. Download the boilerplate
Choose one of the two options:

* [Download](https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/archive/master.zip) the repository as `.zip`
* `git clone` the repository

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run **`npm install`** in your terminal _from the FrontBook directory_. This makes sure all dependencies are installed and you won't run into any errors.

### 3. Build Your Project
After installing all dependencies, you want to build your project. **`npm run dev`** will generate all files from the `src/` directory and move them to `dist/`. You can now access the build on **`http://localhost:9000`**.

> `npm run dev` will automatically `watch` all your source files for any changes!

If you don't to watch all your files but only build the project once, **`npm run build`** is your friend.

## 🛠 Directory Structure
All your source files are located in `src/` and structured as follows:

```
data/
├── meta.json
├── content.json
└── ...
images/
├── frontbook.svg
└── ...
markup/
├── partials/
│   └── head.html
└── index.html
meta/
├── humans.txt
└── ...
scripts/
├── components/
│   └── welcome.js
└── index.js
styles/
├── base/
│   └── ...
├── layout/
│   ├── header.scss
│   └── ...
├── vendors/
│   └── ...
└── index.scss
```

An overview of each folder:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="width:10%">Folder</th>
			<th style="width:65%">Description</th>
			<th style="width:15%">Executable</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>data/</code></td>
			<td>
				Contains all required data <em>(e.g. copy, image meta data, ...)</em> for your views. It is passed to <a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/html#L42">nunjucks</a> when it renders a view.
			</td>
			<td>
				<a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/html"><code>bin/html</code></a>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>images/</code></td>
			<td>
				Contains all images for your project. You could also argue to move them into <code>meta/</code>, or rename the folder to something like <code>assets/</code>. I prefer them separated to have a seperate, unique build task. Currently, images are just copied to <code>dist/</code> but there could also be added an additional image optimization step.
			</td>
			<td>
				<a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/assets#L58"><code>bin/assets</code></a>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>markup/</code></td>
			<td>
				All the views. If your project is a single page application you might just keep the <code>index.html</code> and work with additional includes and partials. If there are more views, such as <code>about.html</code>, they need to be added to the <a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/html">build task</a>.
			</td>
			<td>
				<a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/html"><code>bin/html</code></a>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>meta/</code></td>
			<td>
				FrontBook keeps meta files like <code>humans.txt</code> or a <code>manifest.json</code> here. Some of them might have their own <a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/assets#L12">build step</a>, but all are eventually copied to <code>dist/</code>. If you want to have specific modifications for any meta file, add them to <a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/assets"><code>bin/assets</code></a>.
			</td>
			<td>
				<a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/assets"><code>bin/assets</code></a>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>scripts/</code></td>
			<td>
				Because the main reason for FrontBook is to be able to write ES201* in production, this must be the more exciting part. <br>
				FrontBook doesn't force you to stick to a specific MV* architecture. It simply takes all <code>.js</code> files and compiles them. Hence you can choose whatever design pattern you prefer. If you want to exclude specific files, you need to <a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/js#L20">specify</a> them in the build step.
			</td>
			<td>
				<a href="https://github.com/morkro/FrontBook/blob/master/bin/js"><code>bin/js</code></a>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>styles/</code></td>
			<td>
				FrontBook uses Sass for styling, but it can also easily replaced with any other postprocessor language. The architecture is up to you; if you don't know which architecture to use, take a look at <a href="http://sass-guidelin.es">sass-guidelin.es</a<.
